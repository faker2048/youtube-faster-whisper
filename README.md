# üé• YTWS: YouTube Download and Subtitle Generation Tool üî•

YTWS is a command-line tool designed to download videos from YouTube and generate subtitles, all with the power of the efficient `faster-whisper`.

## üíΩ Installation
You can easily install YTWS using the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/faker2048/youtube-whisper
cd youtube-whisper
pip install .
```

### Preparations Before Running

_Principle: Simplicity is key, and there should be no side effects._

#### ffmpeg
If you don't have ffmpeg installed, you can use the standard method to install ffmpeg in your computer's global environment (not detailed here), or you can use conda to install it in your Python virtual environment (recommended):
```
conda install ffmpeg
```
#### GPU Acceleration
Should you need to install the CUDA and cudnn suite, the following methods provide a simple solution:
- For Linux:
```
conda install cudnn
```
- For Windows:
```
pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# While utilizing additional torch libraries may not be ideal, it's one of the most 
# straightforward approaches I've discovered for Windows (relative to Nvidia's official CUDA 
# installation). If you're aware of alternative methods or suggestions, your insight would be 
# graciously appreciated!
```

These steps aim to make the installation process as seamless as possible. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns!

```bash
# To download videos from YouTube and generate subtitles.
ytws -m large-v2 -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q 
```

```bash
# To generate .srt subtitles only. (This will download only the audio and delete it after transcribing)
ytws -m large-v2 -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q --srt_only
```

```bash
# Runs on cpu
ytws -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q --cpu
