ytws -m large-v2 -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q 
```

```bash
# To generate .srt subtitles only (this downloads only audio, deleting it after transcription).
ytws -m large-v2 -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q --srt_only

# Runs on CPU.
ytws -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvCd8lC4_Q --cpu

```bash
ytws --help
```

## üõ´ GPU Acceleration

For easy CUDA and cuDNN installation:
- Linux:
```bash
conda install cudnn
```

- Windows:

_Although using additional torch libraries may not be ideal, it's a straightforward approach for Windows (compared to Nvidia's official CUDA installation). Any alternative methods or suggestions are welcome!_
```bash
pip3 install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

After these settings, YTWS should work with a GPU.
